## 🧠 Concept

NeedleDrop pays homage to vintage audio gear — with a spinning record UI, tactile sliders, and knobs for EQ control. Think of it like a real-life hi-fi turntable, brought into the digital age with HTML5, Web Audio API, and modern JavaScript frameworks.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript
- **Animation**: CSS/JS + `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Audio**: Web Audio API
